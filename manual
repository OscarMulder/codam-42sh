.SH NAME
vsh \- Vela SHell
.SH SYNOPSIS
minishell
.SH DESCRIPTION
vsh is a beautiful shell.
.SH OPTIONS
vsh does not take any options.
.SH BUILTINS
.RE 0
.RS 3
.po 4
vsh supports a total of 7 builtin commands. One of them, 'vela', is bonus.
.SS echo [-neE] [arg ...]
Output the args, seperated by spaces, followed by a newline. If -n is specified, the trailing newline is not printed. The -e option will enable interpretation of these escape characters: \\a \\b \\E \\e \\f \\n \\r \\t \\v \\. Option -E disables interpretation of escape characters.
.SS cd [dir]
Change the current directory to 'dir'. The variable environment variable HOME is default to 'dir'.
.SS env [REFRESH]
Display the current environment. If supplied with argument 'REFRESH', it will refresh your whole environment.
.SS setenv [name] [value]
Set a environment variable 'name' to 'value'. If no 'value' is specified, 'name' will be set to NULL. If no 'name' is specified, setenv will behave like the env builtin.
.SS unsetenv [name]
Unset environment variable 'name'.
.SS vela
Display our mighty vela logo in ascii art, and continue with business as usual.

.SH REDIRECTION
The following section explains how we handle redirections.
.RS 3
.po 4
.SS Here-document
The redirection operator `<<` allows redirection of lines contained in a shell input file, known as a here-document, to the standard input of a command.

The here-document is treated as a single word that begins after the next newline character (if there are unescaped quotes) and continues until there is a line containing only the delimiter, with no trailing blank characters. Then the next here-document starts, if there is one.


 command<<word
    here-document
 delimiter


If any character in word is quoted, the delimiter is formed by performing quote removal on word, and the here-document lines will not be expanded. Otherwise, the delimiter is the word itself. 

If no characters in word are quoted, all lines of the here-document will be expanded for parameter expansion. In this case, the backslash in the input will behave as the backslash inside double-quotes. However, the double-quote character (") will not be treated specially within a here-document, except when the double-quote appears within ` ` or ${ }.

Probably a lot...
